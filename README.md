**Blackjack**, formerly also **Black Jack** and **Vingt-Un**, is the American member of a global family of [banking games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_card_game_terms#banking_game) known as [Twenty-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_(card_game)), whose relatives include the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un. It is a comparing [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game) between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. Blackjack has over 100 rule variations.


### General Rules

* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.
* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
* If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.
* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.
* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum called a "push", no one wins.
